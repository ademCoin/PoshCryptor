# Ransomware in Powershell!

**SYNOPSIS**
This script encrypts all files within selected folders, posts the encryption key to a Discord webhook, and starts a non closable window
with a notice to the user.

**WARNING**   **WARNING**   **WARNING**   **WARNING**   **WARNING**   **WARNING**   **WARNING**   **WARNING**

THIS IS EFFECTIVELY RANSOMWARE - I CANNOT TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR LOST FILES!

DO NOT USE THIS ON ANY CRITICAL SYSTEMS OR SYSTEMS WITHOUT PERMISSION

THIS IS A PROOF OF CONCEPT TO WRITE RANSOMWARE IN POWERSHELL AND IS FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES
